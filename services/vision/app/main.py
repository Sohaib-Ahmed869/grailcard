# Phone cameras send 12-megapixel photos. Decoded to BGR that is ~36 MB, and
# the pipeline holds several copies at once (the source, the warped card, the
# annotated overlays, then a PNG encode of each). Alongside the OCR models
# already resident, that exceeds a small container and the process is killed
# mid-scan — the caller sees a 502 with no explanation.
#
# Nothing downstream needs that resolution: OCR runs on an 800px-tall crop and
# centering is measured on a fixed 750x1050 canvas. Capping the longest side
# costs no accuracy and cuts both peak memory and CPU time by the square of the
# scale factor. Raise MAX_INPUT_PX on a larger instance.
# DEFAULT OFF. Downscaling is a memory tactic for small containers, and it is
# not free: shrinking a 2048px photo by even 2% lost the collector number off
# the card face, and identification silently fell back to name matching — a
# PSA 10 Umbreon VMAX #215 resolved to the ordinary #95, a ~40x pricing error.
# Only enable it where memory genuinely forces the trade (render.yaml sets it),
# and never below what the OCR needs to read a collector number.
